Welcome to the git repo for Cisco CloudCenter.  This repository will contain scripts, code snippets, integrations and sample Application Profiles that you can use to get more value quickly out of Cisco CloudCenter (C3).  Most code contained within this repo will have corresponding articles that can be found on https://communities.cisco.com/community/technology/cloudsolutions/enterprise-cloud-suite/cloudcenter.

Most of the content will be contained within the master branch.  This content will be "lightly curated" meaning the CloudCenter technical marketing team is contributing and testing content to validate interoperablity with different versions and the 3rd party ecosystem of products that CloudCenter works with.  The content is organized into the following folders and each subfolder will get a github project associated with it so that we can track issues and requests on a per topic basis.  Each folder should contain a readme.md file that has some detail of the project and a link to the Cisco communities article that explains the intended purpose and outcome.



Application Profiles -
    Sample application profiles, each within its own folder, both open source and commercial applications for import or setup within CloudCenter.  The commercial applications will of course refer to program executables and licensing that will have to be provided by each user in accordance with the terms, conditions and EULA from the corresponding company which provides that software product.

Services -
    These services are the building blocks that make up the reusable components of an Application Profile within CloudCenter.  Many services ship with CloudCenter with each release but others are provided here as enhancements, newer versions or simply services that aren't currently included

Integrations -
    These integrations vary in purpose and how CloudCenter can consume them but they provide value for the clouds, applications and infrastructure that CloudCenter interacts with during the deployment, management and lifecycle of virtual infrastructure and applications.  New "Action Library" features of the C3 v4.8 release can also be found in this category.



TODO -  
    Add details about Solution Support by Cisco TAC as it relates to the content within this repository
